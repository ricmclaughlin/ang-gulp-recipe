Angular Gulp Recipe

In the quest to build the ultimate Angular Gulpfile I worked through a couple of gulp classes and then set out to make my own using smatterings of each class and blog article I read. This is the result. Technics I have implemented here include:

0. Helpers & Organization - First, it's a bit of a obvious statement but gulp is a Javascript tool so you can create reusable functions inside your <code>gulpfile.js</code>. Logging application progress and debugging information &amp; deleting files are operations that happen all over so why not DRY those aspects of your gulpfile up by creating reusable functions? Second, extracting the configuration including files locations and options passed to plugins can be extracted into a seperate <code>gulp.config.js</code> file. Third, loading all of the important gulp plugins ends up being quite a bit of dependency management - why not load the plugins dynamically, when needed, using the super handy [gulp-load-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-load-plugins)? Plus when you use the gulp-load-plugins plugin you get to refer to plugins generically as <code>$</code> and after so much jQuery I kinda miss typing <code>$</code> and this really helps me feel better! Fourth, gulpif
Fifth, gulp plumber

1. Syntax checking with [JSHint](https://github.com/spalger/gulp-jshint) & [JSCS](https://github.com/jscs-dev/gulp-jscs) - I'm not a super big fan of syntax error checking in my dev tool. I like it at the command line so some of the functionality of JSHine and JSCS are lost on me. But that does NOT mean I don't like it at compile time. The ability to keep good style and syntax is great when integrated into the build task. 

2. CSS Compilation with [gulp-less](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-lessgulp) & [gulp-autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) - The website I did this project on uses [less](http://lesscss.org/) instead of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) so this app isn't an exact recipe of how I do things - less is fading and Sass is on the rise. So lets talk Sass instead of less - the speed advantage of [libsass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass) over [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) makes the automation of these processes worth the weight of implementation and when you add CSS vendor prefixing using [gulp-autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) to the mix... well, you have a ton of goodness.

3. HTML, CSS & JS Injection with [wiredep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wiredep) & [gulp-inject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-inject) - Automajically adding [bower](http://bower.io/) dependencies using an already-compatible-with-gulp [wiredep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wiredep) makes this problem disappear. Combining and "injecting" CSS dependencies and JavaScript dependencies that YOU authored or added outside of bower in tools like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is easily accomplished with [gulp-inject](https://github.com/klei/gulp-inject). The big advantage is that you no longer have to worry about wiring up all the dependencies in your base template - add your files to correct directory using the right tools and everything happens for you... easily.

4. Serving a dev build with [gulp-nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-nodemon) - All this building and transformation of your files makes it very important to preview the dev, qa AND production app locally. Luckily there is a nice little package that allows you to integrate a live server with automatic reloads when you change to source files.
